## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyse and visualize Time Series data to predict the impact of COVID-19 in India. To figure out if Lockdown was quickly implemented and what will be the impact if the lockdown is withdrawn.

### Methods Used
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Time Series Analysis
* Forecasting Modeling
* Non-Linear Regression
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Google Colab
* Plotly
* Folium
* Pandas
* Facebook Prophet
* Jupyter
* etc.

## Project Description
Using the data provided by [University of Kalyani](https://github.com/kalyaniuniversity/COVID-19-Datasets) we analyzed and visualized the Covid-19 cases across Indian states and union territories. We found out the top 5 worse hit states alongside the states which have been performing better than the rest. We also found out mortality rate and recovery rate across Indian states. We also predicted the number of cases that could have taken place in April if no Lockdown was implemented by the Indian Goverment. And in the end we used FBProphet's forecasting tools to figure out how each phases of lockdown affected the future number of cases and if starting Unlockdown on June 1 was a bad idea.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Get into the folder using `cd Impact-of-lockdown-in-India-COVID-19`.
3. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    * Make sure you use Python 3.
    * You may want to use a virtual environment for this.
4. Create a .env file and fill it with your MapBox API key like this - `API=your_api_key_without_quotes`
5. Run the analysis.ipynb in Jupyter.
